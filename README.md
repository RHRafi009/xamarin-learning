# xamarin-learning

## What is this?
This repository contains all the codes and notes that I've written in my xamarin learning path. Anybody can see this and reference this for there need. If you want to contribute then you just need to send a pull request :relaxed:. All though I'm not expecting that anybody will do that :relieved:.

## Learning resource
I am currently following a course from Udemy for this. But I'll also read the official documentation whenever I need them and I encourage people to do the same. 

1. [Course link](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-xamarin-developer-course-ios-and-android/)
2. [Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/)

**This is by no means a solution of the course materials and exercises. I don't support cheating and strongly against it.**
